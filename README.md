# Federated Learning for Object Detection in  Autonomous Vehicles
# Objective
  To analyze  Federated Learning(FL)  impact  during  object  detection  on  real-world  traffic environment, we have constructed an FL system evaluated on the KITTI  Vision  Benchmark  2D  image  dataset.

# Dataset
KITTI 2D image dataset can be downloaded from http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php?obj_benchmark. The dataset has 11 classes of objects, viz. Car, Van, Truck, Pedestrian,Person_sitting, Cyclist, Tram, Misc or DontCare
